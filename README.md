# Huffman Encoder/Decoder in C

This project implements **Static Huffman's Algorithm** for file compression and decompression. It consists of two main programs:

- **Encoder**: Compresses a `.txt` file by generating Huffman codes for each character based on their frequencies.
- **Decoder**: Decompresses the binary file generated by the encoder, restoring the original text.

## Features

- **Efficient Compression**: Achieves significant file size reduction using Huffman's algorithm, with a compression rate of approximately 60% in testing.
- **Lossless Compression**: The encoded file can be perfectly decoded to retrieve the original content.
- **Binary Encoding**: Outputs a binary file after encoding, which is then decoded back to the original `.txt` file.
- **Frequency Encoding**: The frequency of each character is embedded within the binary file for proper decoding.

## How It Works

1. **Encoder**:
   - Reads a `.txt` file.
   - Calculates the frequency of each character in the file.
   - Builds a Huffman tree based on character frequencies.
   - Generates Huffman codes for each character.
   - Writes a binary file with encoded data and character frequency information.

2. **Decoder**:
   - Reads the binary file generated by the encoder.
   - Reconstructs the Huffman tree using the frequency data embedded in the binary file.
   - Decodes the binary data back into the original text.

## Compression Test

The algorithm was tested with a 5MB `.txt` file:
- **Compression Success**: The original file was successfully encoded and decoded, with the output identical to the input.
- **Compression Rate**: Achieved approximately **60% compression**.
